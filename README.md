# ASH SIS Automation

Automation plugins and scripts for ASH PowerSchool SIS.

## Overview

PowerSchool SIS generates reports on a schedule set in the Data Export Manager (*Functions > Importing & Exporting > Data Export Manager*). Reports are transmitted to an internal SSH host (see [internal documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JPArXP_7C58uMpqMbwHHK_5DDGpmmQw2)). 

Documents deposited on the SSH host are processed and forwarded on to the appropriate user groups with links to documentation and instructions particular to the document. All documents should only be mailed to google group addresses within the domain. Distribution lists are maintained exclusively through the google groups.
